# Achohol-By-Volume
## Introduction
- This project involves working with lists and dictionaries, a more demanding text processing, and a bit of math. The file ‘shooters.txt’ contains a nicely-formatted list of recipes for one-ounce (1 oz.) alcoholic called ‘shooters’.  Like many alcoholic mixed drinks, shooters vary greatly as to how much alcohol they contain. The typical way of indicating the level of alcohol is by specifying Alcohol By Volume (ABV), which is the percent of alcohol in the drink.  The goal of this project is to update the recipes by providing ABV for each drink and its alcoholic ingredients, and writing the updated recipes in ‘NewShooters.txt’.  Use the file ‘ingredientsABV.txt’, which has ABV for each ingredient.

## Features
1. A file ‘newShooters.txt’ will print out the recipes organized in alphabetical order of the shooter names, and where every alcoholic ingredient indicates its alcohol by volume content. The non-alcoholic ingredients should not have any specified ABV.  
2. Every alcoholic ingredient will indicate not only its alcohol by volume content but also the amount of alcohol in ounces (oz.) rounded to two decimal places.  
3. The file will find the total percent of alcohol by volume (ABV) for each shooter, and sorts the recipes from smallest total ABV to largest.
